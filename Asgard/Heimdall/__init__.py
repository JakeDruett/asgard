"""
Heimdall - GAIA Code Quality Control and Analysis

Named after the Norse watchman god who guards Bifrost and can see and hear
everything across all realms. Like its namesake, Heimdall watches over your
codebase for quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and performance problems.

Subpackages:
- Quality: Code metrics, complexity, duplication, code smells, technical debt
- Security: Vulnerability scanning, secrets detection, injection patterns
- Performance: Memory profiling, CPU analysis, database optimization
- OOP: Object-oriented metrics (CBO, DIT, LCOM, RFC, WMC)
- Dependencies: Dependency graphs, circular detection, modularity analysis
- Architecture: SOLID validation, layer compliance, pattern detection
- Coverage: Test coverage gaps, test suggestions, class coverage

Usage:
    python -m Heimdall --help
    python -m Heimdall quality analyze ./src
    python -m Heimdall security scan ./src
    python -m Heimdall performance scan ./src
    python -m Heimdall oop analyze ./src
    python -m Heimdall dependencies analyze ./src
    python -m Heimdall architecture analyze ./src
    python -m Heimdall coverage analyze ./src
    python -m Heimdall audit ./src

Programmatic Usage:
    from Asgard.Heimdall.Quality import FileAnalyzer, AnalysisConfig
    from Asgard.Heimdall.Security import StaticSecurityService, SecurityScanConfig
    from Asgard.Heimdall.Performance import StaticPerformanceService, PerformanceScanConfig
    from Asgard.Heimdall.OOP import OOPAnalyzer, OOPConfig
    from Asgard.Heimdall.Dependencies import DependencyAnalyzer, DependencyConfig
    from Asgard.Heimdall.Architecture import ArchitectureAnalyzer, ArchitectureConfig
    from Asgard.Heimdall.Coverage import CoverageAnalyzer, CoverageConfig

    # Quality Analysis
    config = AnalysisConfig(threshold=300)
    analyzer = FileAnalyzer(config)
    result = analyzer.analyze()

    # Security Analysis
    security_service = StaticSecurityService()
    security_report = security_service.scan("./src")
    print(f"Security Score: {security_report.security_score}/100")

    # Performance Analysis
    perf_service = StaticPerformanceService()
    perf_report = perf_service.scan("./src")
    print(f"Performance Score: {perf_report.performance_score}/100")

    # OOP Analysis
    oop_analyzer = OOPAnalyzer()
    oop_report = oop_analyzer.analyze("./src")
    print(f"Classes Analyzed: {oop_report.total_classes}")

    # Dependency Analysis
    dep_analyzer = DependencyAnalyzer()
    dep_report = dep_analyzer.analyze("./src")
    print(f"Circular Dependencies: {dep_report.total_cycles}")

    # Architecture Analysis
    arch_analyzer = ArchitectureAnalyzer()
    arch_report = arch_analyzer.analyze("./src")
    print(f"SOLID Violations: {arch_report.total_violations}")

    # Coverage Analysis
    cov_analyzer = CoverageAnalyzer()
    cov_report = cov_analyzer.analyze("./src")
    print(f"Coverage Gaps: {cov_report.total_gaps}")
