Asgard - GAIA Development Tools Suite

Named after the realm of the Norse gods, Asgard is GAIA's comprehensive
suite of development and quality assurance tools. Like the mythical realm
that houses the great halls of the Aesir, Asgard houses the tools that
watch over and forge GAIA's codebase.

Subpackages:
    Heimdall: Code quality control and static analysis (the watchman)
    Freya: Visual and UI testing (the goddess of beauty)
    Forseti: API and schema specification (the god of justice/contracts)
    Verdandi: Runtime performance metrics (the Norn of the present)
    Volundr: Infrastructure generation (the master smith)
