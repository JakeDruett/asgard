Verdandi APM - Application Performance Monitoring

This module provides APM capabilities including:
- Span analysis for individual operations
- Trace aggregation for service-level metrics
- Service dependency map generation

Usage:
    from Asgard.Verdandi.APM import SpanAnalyzer, TraceAggregator, ServiceMapBuilder

    # Analyze spans
    analyzer = SpanAnalyzer()
    analysis = analyzer.analyze(spans)

    # Aggregate traces
    aggregator = TraceAggregator()
    service_metrics = aggregator.aggregate(traces)

    # Build service map
    builder = ServiceMapBuilder()
    service_map = builder.build(traces)
